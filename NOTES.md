Introduction
============

Experiments to understand: "A monad is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors, what's the probleâ…¿?"

Most of the stuff is just re-iteration of what is said and learnt from the refrences given.

* Functor Composition
  * mapping objects
  * mapping morphisms

* Moniods
  * binary operation
  * identity law
  * associativity law

* Monad as monoid
  * binary operation
  * identity law
  * associativity law
  * return vs. id and bind vs. join

Two things to keep in mind:
  - A functor is a way of operating on the content of something without touching the structure.
  - A natural transformation is a way of operating on the structure of something without touching or looking at the content.

The dirty details are spelled out in https://github.com/saibaba/monad_monoid/blob/master/README.md.

* Nice example of natural transformation and an example where it does not apply: https://stackoverflow.com/a/58364169 (another one comes to mind, you have a stream of Employee objects and stream is in the order of tenure- you built a generic function to handle the stream, generic in the sense does not know it is holding Employee objects - your boss suddenly tells to increase salary by 10% for first x employees, the generic function now does not work as it does not know that it is holding Employee objects, you have to make it to type specific to access/update salary field of Employee - you break natural transformation)
