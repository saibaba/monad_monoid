============

Experiments to understand: "A monad is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors, what's the probleâ…¿?"

More pragmatically these experiments help to internalize that:
  - A functor is a way of operating on the content of something without touching the structure.
  - A natural transformation is a way of operating on the structure of something without touching or looking at the content.
