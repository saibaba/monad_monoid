Introduction
============

Experiments to understand: "A monad is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors, what's the probleâ…¿?"

Most of the stuff is just re-iteration of what is said and learnt from the refrences given.

* Functor Composition
  * mapping objects
  * mapping morphisms

* Moniods
  * binary operation
  * identity law
  * associativity law

* Monad as monoid
  * binary operation
  * identity law
  * associativity law

Two things to keep in mind:
  - A functor is a way of operating on the content of something without touching the structure.
  - A natural transformation is a way of operating on the structure of something without touching or looking at the content.
